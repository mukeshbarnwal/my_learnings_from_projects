# my_learnings_from_projects
I would write my learnings from business projects I have done so far. 

While doing various projects I learned quite a lot of things. Now when I reflect, I realise it is important to write it down so that it gets stick to my mind and I get better with time and further improve on it.

One of my latest project was metadata extraction from documents involving generative ai models. 
My learnings were as follows: 
1. Decide the scope of the project soon. By scope, it is meant what does the client want. It is important that there is clarity in it because a problem defined is half the problem solved. If the problem is not defined, one cannot propose a solution. Or if a problem is defined half-way, still working on it may not be worthwhile because you may have to change the solution if the problem changes. As a result, efforts and time would go in vain. Therefore, the more clarity there is in scope of project, the better it is.
   
2. This point is a continuation of the first one. While it is important for the scope to be decided and this surely takes time to get the required clarity, but as a developer one should always be ready with the plan and potential ways of execution. This includes the architecture of the project, proposed range of solutions, best solution that would go wtih the project, the core logic with basic code that would solve the problem, an end-to-end codebase with the basic logic and placeholders for the entry and ouput points. This is important as it gives you the momentum, provides you cofidence, saves you time and prepares you for the process ahead.
   
3. Know the business outcome of the project you are in. Any project involves solving a bigger problem. You should know what that problem is. How the problem is affecting your clients. Can you help them in any way? Can you build something that would help them overcoming the problem they are facing. Know the scale of the problem. How big the problem is? How the problem is impacting the business negatively and how your solution will help to address the problem and drive the business forward? In short, you should know the business use-case end-to-end that you are solving. For whom you are solving it? For what reason you are solving it. This provides motivation to come up with a fine-grained and innovative solution and helps you stick to your solution till the end since you have a problem to solve now which you connect with.
